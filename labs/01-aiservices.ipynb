    "# Lab 0.1 - Azure AI Services\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure AI Services allow you to build cutting-edge, market-ready AI applications with out-of-the-box and customizable APIs and models.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these services are available in the Azure portal, and can be accessed through SDKs and APIs. Some of them allow you to bring your own models and data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Brose the service directory [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services#Services).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example - Azure AI Document Intelligence\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure AI Document Intelligence is a collection of pre-trained AI models that extract insights from your documents such as forms, tables, and receipts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use this service as an example to how Azure AI services can be used in an application.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Load the environment variables\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend creating a .env file with the following variables defined. .env files are ignored when pushing code to GitHub and are a good way to keep secrets out of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, we'll be reusing these variables in other notebooks, so it's a good idea to keep them in a single place."
