    "# Lab 2.2 - Chat with your own data\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common scenarios for enterprise usage of LLMs is to use company data to ground the model's response. This allows customers to biold solutions that leverage the power of LLMs to create solutions that are tailored to their specific needs. In this lab, you will learn how to use your own data to chat with a LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the heart of these scenarios lies the RAG pattern mentioned before and there's multiple ways to implement it. In this lab, we'll be using the \"Add your own data\" feature of Azure AI Studio to effortessly create a chatbot that uses your own data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say I'm an employee of a company called Contoso. If I ask the GPT model about my available health plans, it won't know about the specifics of Contoso's health plans. \n",
    "\n",
    "![ContosoHealthPlans](../img/owndata00.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if Contoso has grounded an LLM on it's own data, then this scenario would be possible. This is exactely what we'll build on this lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "* Make sure you have completed the previous labs in this series so you have a working playground and a model deployed.\n",
    "* Download the sample PDF file to your environment. The PDF file is available in this repo in the [data](../data/ContosoHealth.pdf) folder or online at https://github.com/mooncowboy/ai-zerotohero/blob/main/data/ContosoHealth.pdf\n",

    "## Step 2.1 - Create Azure AI Search resource\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Add your own data\" feature of Azure AI Studio uses Azure AI Search to index and search your data. If you don't have an Azure AI Search resource, you can create one by following these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the Azure portal, click on \"Create a resource\" in the top left corner.\n",
    "2. Search for \"Search\" and click on \"Create\".\n",
    "3. Specify the subscription, resource group, region, and name for the resource. **Note that the Free tier does not support some of the features we'll be using in this lab.**\n",
    "4. Leave the defaults for Scale, Networking and Tags\n",
    "5. Click on \"Review + create\" and then \"Create\" to create the resource.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2.2 - Start the \"Add your own data\" wizard\n",
    "\n",
    "There's multiple ways to add data. Also, if adding data from a location like a storage account, you have the option to periodically update the data. For this lab, we'll be using a file upload and we'll be uploading the PDF file we downloaded in the prerequisites.\n",
    "\n",
    "Navigate back to Azure AI Studio and click on \"Add your own data\".\n",
    "\n",
    "![Add your own data](../img/owndata01.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2.3 - Upload the ContosoHealth.pdf file\n",
    "\n",
    "Click on \"Upload\" and select the PDF file you downloaded in the prerequisites.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Upload PDF](../img/owndata02.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2.4 - Configure the data source\n",
    "\n",
    "Under \"Select Azure AI Search resource\", select \"Connect other AI Search resource\" and choose the Azure AI Search resource you created in Step 2.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can customize the index name to something more meaningful (eg: contosohealthpdf).\n",
    "* Leave the Virtual Machine options as \"Auto Select\". \n",
    "\n",
    "![Choose AI Search](../img/owndata03.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2.5 - Configure search settings\n",
    "\n",
    "To support some of the search scenarios we'll be using, we need to enable Vector search. This means we'll need an embedding model deployed in our hub. If you haven't done this yet, make sure you deploy the text-embedding-ada-002 model.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Enable Vector Search](../img/owndata04.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Review the search settings and continue. **This will take a while to complete.**"
